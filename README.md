# Binance and Bybit P2P Rates

Using this project, you can take p2p values ​​from binance (using the **free API**) and p2p values ​​from bybit (using **selenium**)
All this is displayed in the telegram bot.

In order for this to be displayed in the bot, you will need a token, you will need to create a bot via @BotFather, then this same token will be displayed and it will need to be inserted into the file in a certain line (I will add detailed instructions later)
